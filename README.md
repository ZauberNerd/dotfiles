My dotfiles

Managed via [rcm][1]


Most of this is pretty standard and some of it is taken from other peoples dotfiles.

The `git publish` and `git draft` aliases in the [gitconfig][2] are used for [gerrit code review][3].
The [git-completion.sh][4] contains code to autocomplete the branchname for `git publish` and `git draft`.
